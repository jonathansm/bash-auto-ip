# bash-auto-ipAs a network engineer I copy and paste IPs into the terminal daily. I usually forget to add the command I'm trying to run before I copy and paste the IP which would result in: ```Jonathans-MacBook:~ jonathansmith$ 10.0.0.0-bash: 10.0.0.0: command not found```Me being a lazy and a programmer (usually goes hand in hand) wanted my terminal to be smarter, so I wrote this little bash script that over rights the `command_not_found_handle()` function in `bash` that checks to see if it's an IP.Now I can enter in just an IP at the bash prompt and it will ask what want to do with it i.e ssh, ping, host or telnetYou need at least version 4 of bash for this to work```bashecho $BASH_VERSION4.4.5(1)-release```If you don’t have version 4 follow these steps to upgrade###MacInstall homebrew if you don’t have it already```ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"```Run these```bashbrew install bashsudo bash -c 'echo /usr/local/bin/bash >> /etc/shells'chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash```Relaunch terminal ###Linux```bashapt-get autocleanapt-get install --only-upgrade bashapt-get upgrade```Once you have bash version 4 you are ready to overide the `command_not_found_handle()` function###InstallCopy the contents of the bashrc file to your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file. Mac uses `.bash_profile` and Linux uses `.bashrc`. After copying it relaunch terminal###Success!Now when you type just an IP into the terminal you'll get this```Jonathans-MacBook:~ jonathansmith$ 10.0.0.01) ssh
2) ping
3) telnet
4) host
5) QuitPlease enter your choice: ```Instead of this```Jonathans-MacBook:~ jonathansmith$ 10.0.0.0-bash: 10.0.0.0: command not found```Just pick what you want and off you go

####Future?
Maybe in the future I'll add the ability to recognize domain names. Not too hard just don't run into that as much.
